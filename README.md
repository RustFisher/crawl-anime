# Crawl Animation data

* Python3
* scrapy

Get data form internet step by step and save data locally.

#### Here are 2 scrapy projects:
#####  bang
Fetch data from bangumi.  
Actually most animation data from here.  
Save data to JSON and MySQL on my machine.

#####  anidb
Fetch data from anidb. Main target is score.  
Establish the link between bangumi and anidb.  
Like `anime_bang_id` -- `anime_anidb_id`  
Then we can get animation data via `anime_bang_id` or `anime_anidb_id`
